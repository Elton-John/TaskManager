# TaskManager
:boom: My first projekt in **JAVA**. Add and remove information using **CSV** file.

# This is how it works
It's my first bigger console program, which can comunicate with user.

The program offers the user 4 options:

* :star2:**ADD** - to add a task description, deadline and task importance. 
* :star2:**LIST** - to see a numbered list of all tasks. 
* :star2:**REMOVE** - to delete the task by entering the number. 
* :star2:**EXIT** - to save all changes to a csv file (which will also be read the next time you start the program) and exit the program. 

Not much, but very satisfying for me at the beginning of my Java learning :blush:

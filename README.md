# TaskManager
:boom: My first project in **JAVA**. Add and remove information using **CSV** file.

MIT license (It lets people do almost anything they want with the project, like making and distributing closed source versions)

# This is how it works
It's my first bigger console program, which can communicate with user.

The program gives user 4 options:

* :star2:**ADD** - to add new task: its description, deadline and task importance. 
* :star2:**LIST** - to see a numbered list of all tasks. 
* :star2:**REMOVE** - to delete the task by entering the number. 
* :star2:**EXIT** - to save all changes to a csv file (which will also be read the next time you start the program) and exit the program. 

Not much, but very satisfying for me at the beginning of my Java learning :blush:
